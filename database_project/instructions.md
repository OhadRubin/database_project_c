Final Project for Advanced Topics in Data Management Course

- Select 2 topics from the list of topics studied in class.

- Your project must implement algorithms from both selected topics (and from papers studied under these topics), integrating them effectively. For example:

  - Implementing provenance tracking with applications of provenance both in the context of semirings and probabilistic databases.
  - Combining incomplete information with data imputation: estimating queries over databases with missing data by introducing variables, then performing targeted data imputation focused on variables relevant to query results.
  - Rank aggregation with missing information, complemented by data imputation (analyzing how different imputation methods affect ranking).

- You can use any programming language. Existing libraries may be used for parts of the functionality, but you must explicitly define which algorithms you implemented yourselfâ€”the newly implemented algorithms should constitute the main component of your project.

- You are not required to implement the full functionality of the algorithms from the selected papers, but you must clearly define your project's scope. Specifically, you may restrict your query language to conjunctive queries or unions of conjunctive queries. Document your choices clearly.

- The user interface must allow input (such as queries) but does not need to be graphical. In your documentation, explain how to run the project and how to input data.

- Run your code on a dataset from:
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv or
  - https://data.un.org/DataMartInfo.aspx
  (You may also select another dataset from the web).

- Define relevant analytical questions to examine using your code and/or about your code: runtime, quality of results, etc. Perform the analyses and report the results.

- Submit your code, the dataset you chose, and a file including:
  (a) A general description of the project: objectives and high-level solution overview.
  (b) Detailed explanations of the algorithms and methods implemented, and how they integrate with each other.
  (c) Instructions on how to run the project.
  (d) Example runs.
  (e) Code documentation.
  (f) Details of analyses performed (runtime, quality of results for approximate algorithms, etc.) and their results.

Grading Criteria: Below are the criteria to guide your work and the project's evaluation:

- Originality/creativity (interesting integration of topics, leveraging one topic to enhance the other, meaningful conclusions).
- Versatility and generality (variety of inputs and scenarios).
- Execution (usability, correctness, reasonable runtime, etc.).
- Design and documentation (code and data).
- Analysis and conclusions (clear explanation of expectations vs. actual results, etc.).
- Quality of data (real or interestingly synthesized datasets).
