**Course Title**: Advanced Topics in Data Management

**Course Description**:  
This course covers foundational and cutting-edge topics in data management, with an emphasis on formal query languages, probabilistic reasoning, large-scale data processing, and data provenance. Students explore both the theoretical and practical aspects of querying and processing structured, semi-structured, and uncertain data.
